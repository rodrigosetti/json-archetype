# JSON Archetype

A JSON test helper tool. It compares the so called "JSON archetype", which is a
superset of JSON language, with one or more JSON files and output expected
structure.

The archetype is a specification of the expected JSON format. It can be an
strict definition of a JSON, but in a lot of cases it's desired to have some
generality, _e. g._ a "number" (with any value), or "boolean", or structured
values such as lists (with any values), _etc._

For these scenarios, the archetype is an augmented JSON where one can specify
exactly matching, type matching (through type keywords, such as "number",
"object", _etc._), quantity qualifiers (optional, zero or more, one or more,
_etc._), and regular expression (for strings and keys).

## Usage:

    json-test <options> [file [file ...]]
      -h           --help                Display help information
      -a FILENAME  --archetype=FILENAME  The JSON archetype file name

If no JSON filename is given, then reads from standard input.

## Example

Take, for example, the following JSON archetype:

    /**
     * JSON archetype language is a superset of JSON, and can accept C-style
     * comments (block or line) to help documenting your test.
     */

    /* one can assign values to names, and use them later to reuse parts.
       This is also an example of a non-trivial use of a regular expression
       to validate an IP address. */
    ip_address =  "[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}"
    server = { "ip": ip_address,
               "port": 8080,
               "protocol": "http"}

    {
        "name": string,
        "version" ?: 2,          // this key is optional (?)
        "data(-.*)?" *: object,  // this key is a regular expression, and may
                                 // appear zero or more times
        "is_member"   : boolean, // true or false (type restriction)
        "is_active"   : true,    // only true (value restriction)
        "coordinates" : ["geo", number{3}], // any array with "geo" and 3 numbers
        "stream": [number*],     // a stream is an array of zero or more numbers

        // reusing pre-defined structures. This key should appear three times:
        "[a-z]+_server" {3}: server,

        "state" : [string{2,3}, number+], // 2-3 strings and one or more numbers

        "extra": any // accepts any value here. the key "extra" must exist.
    }

It defines a structure a JSON must have in order to be valid. The JSON can be
validated with an exact value (_e.g._ "http"), or with a type constrain such as
`string` or `number`, or even regular expressions (in string literals or object
key identifiers). Actually every string and key matching is a regular
expression matching, so please be mindful of special characters and proper
escaping.

For the given archetype, the following JSON is an example of a valid one (note
that order matters in arrays, but it doesn't in objects):

    {
        "version": 2,
        "is_member" : false,
        "name": "John Smith",
        "is_active" : true,
        "stream": [7, 7, 7, 10, 22, 12, 2, 8],
        "coordinates": ["geo", 3123, 133, 319],

        "dev_server"   : {"ip": "127.0.0.1",   "port": 8080, "protocol": "http"},
        "stage_server" : {"ip": "200.6.5.1",   "port": 8080, "protocol": "http"},
        "prod_server"  : {"ip": "192.178.1.1", "port": 8080, "protocol": "http"},

        "data-color": {"red": 10, "green": 20, "blue": 6},
        "data-font" : {"family": "Lucida", "size": 10, "unit": "pt"},

        "extra": {"foo": "bar",
                  "bar": null},
        "state": ["spam", "eggs", 1, 2, 3]
    }

## SYNTAX

On top of normal JSON syntax, one can use "type qualifiers", anywhere a JSON
value could be, to identify that a value must be of a specific type: `object``,
`list`, `string`, `number`, `boolean`, or `any` (`null` is a type and a value
itself).

Quantity qualifiers can be optionally used right after array values and object
key literals to specify that the given array value or object key/value pair
should occur a certain number of times. They have the same syntax as their
POSIX regular expressions counterparts: `?` (optional), `*` (zero or more), `+`
(one or more), `{n}` (n repetitions), or `{n,m}` (n to m repetitions).
